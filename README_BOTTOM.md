## Next Steps & Important Notes

*   **Complete AWS Setup:** Ensure the IAM OIDC Role, GitHub Secrets (`AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME`, `SAM_S3_BUCKET_NAME`), and ECR repository are correctly set up as described in the "Prerequisites for Production Deployment" section.
*   **SAM S3 Bucket:** The `SAM_S3_BUCKET_NAME` secret should point to an S3 bucket you own, used by `sam deploy` for packaging.
*   **Amplify Configuration:** Double-check your AWS Amplify settings to ensure it's correctly building from the `main` branch and that its environment variables point to the production API Gateway endpoint.
*   **Local Development:** The new `just dev` command simplifies local development significantly - use it as your primary way to start the development environment.
